The JSON files in this directory are generated by making several thousand API calls to Etsy then optimizing/semi-normalizing the
results. They're all generated by running the dataFileGenerator script.

This script is run in two stages-- first, with the fetch argument ```node dataFileGenerator.js --fetch``` to make all the api calls and store the results in the
cached-api-results directory.

The second time it's run with the merge argument: ```node dataFileGenerator.js --merge``` which will combine all those files into the ones in this directory.

The only place these data files are consumed is in the taxonomyNodeProperties.js module which is responsible for providing an interface for determining properties, scales and options
to callers.
